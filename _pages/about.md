I am a doctoral candidate at the Lundquist College of Business. I received my B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Ecole Mohammadia dâ€™Ingenieurs and MPA from Cornell University as a Fulbright Scholar. My research lies in the intersection of strategy and entrepreneurship economics. Using experimental and quasi-experimental approaches, I investigate the different mechanisms used by intermediaries that finance and support early stage ventures. I also draw upon large-scale data to examine different aspects of the geography of entrepreneurship. My projects are based in a range of contexts including public finding programs, startup acceleration programs, and crowdfunding.
