Ouafaa is a doctoral candidate at the Lundquist College of Business. She received her BS in Industrial Engineering from Ecole Mohammadia dâ€™Ingenieurs and her MPA from Cornell University as a Fulbright Scholar. Her research lies in the intersection of strategy and entrepreneurship economics. Using experimental and quasi-experimental approaches, she investigates the different mechanisms used by intermediaries that finance and support early stage ventures. She also draws upon large-scale data to examine different aspects of the geography of entrepreneurship. Her projects are based in a range of contexts including public finding programs, startup acceleration programs, and crowdfunding.
